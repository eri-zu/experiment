# Interactive particle animation

## 📝 Overview

This project compares two methods of generating particle positions:

- **Plane Geometry**  
  Positions are obtained directly from the vertices of a plane.

- **Custom Geometry (from image data)**  
  Positions are extracted by analyzing image pixel data using Canvas2D.
